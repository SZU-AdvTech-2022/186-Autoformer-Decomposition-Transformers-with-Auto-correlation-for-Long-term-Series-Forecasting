## Get Started
1. Install Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.12.1.
2. Download data. You can obtain all the six benchmarks from [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/e1ccfff39ad541908bae/) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy?usp=sharing). **All the datasets are well pre-processed** and can be used easily.
3. Just run the 'run.py' to train the model and get the result.
